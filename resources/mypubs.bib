  abstract = {We study preference representation models based on partial lexicographic preference trees
(PLP-trees). We propose to represent preference relations as forests of small PLP-trees
(PLP-forests), and to use voting rules to aggregate orders represented by the individual
trees into a single order to be taken as a model of the agent’s preference relation. We show
that when learned from examples, PLP-forests have better accuracy than single PLP-trees.
We also show that the choice of a voting rule does not have a major effect on the aggregated order, thus 
rendering the problem of selecting the “right” rule less critical. Next, for
the proposed PLP-forest preference models, we develop methods to compute optimal and
near-optimal outcomes, the tasks that appear difficult for some other common preference
models. Lastly, we compare our models with those based on decision trees, which brings up
questions for future research.},

	abstract = {The global climate change research has been conducted for a few years in various professional communities. 
In the building industry, researchers usually investigate the future building energy demands due to the climate change 
by simulation software. The input  les to the simulation software includes projected weather data and building models. 
Although there exist a few mathematical methods to project the future weather, the morphing method is the most well-known among them. 
In the meantime, the simulation software and weather data are in a variety of formats depending on country of origin and/or simulation package. 
In order to provide both the research and the professional communities the possibility to undertake climate change impact assessments on buildings, 
coastal engineering and construction, land use and other related areas, this study develops the web-based application Weather Morph: 
Climate Change Weather File Generator accessible to generate the future weather data for more than 2100 locations throughout the world for all 
four IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change) emission scenarios in the three future time slices of the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. 
The output of the application is projected future weather datasets in formats TMY2 and EPW for general use.},

making process that involves choosing preferred options. We focus on qualitative preference models over alternatives from 
combinatorial domains. This framework is interactive: the user provides her behavioral data to the framework, and the 
framework explains the learned model to the user. It is iterative: the framework collects feedback on the learned model from 
the user and tries to improve it accordingly till the user terminates the iteration. In order to communicate the 
learned preference model to the user, we develop visualization of intuitive and explainable graphic models, such as lexicographic 
preference trees and forests, and conditional preference networks. 
To this end, we discuss key aspects of our framework for lexicographic preference models.

Given a set of examples that are pairwise ordinal preferences over a universe of objects built of attributes of discrete values, 
we want to learn (1) an optimal LP-list that decides the maximum number of these examples, or (2) a near-optimal LP-list that decides as many examples as it 
can. To this end, we introduce a dynamic programming based algorithm and a genetic algorithm for these two learning problems, respectively. 
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that the sub-optimal models computed by the genetic algorithm very well approximate the de facto 
optimal models computed by our dynamic programming based algorithm, and that the genetic algorithm outperforms the baseline greedy heuristic with 
higher accuracy predicting new preferences.},

	abstract = {Despite a tremendous amount of work in the literature and in the commercial sectors, current approaches to multi-modal 
trip planning still fail to consistently generate plans that users deem optimal in practice. We believe that this is 
due to the fact that current planners fail to capture the true preferences of users, e.g., their preferences depend on aspects that are not modeled. 
An example of this could be a preference not to walk through an unsafe area at night. We present a novel multi-modal trip planner that allows users to 
upload auxiliary geographic data (e.g., crime rates) and to specify temporal constraints and preferences over these data in combination with typical metrics 
such as time and cost. Concretely, our planner supports the modes walking, biking, driving, public transit, and taxi, uses linear temporal logic to 
capture temporal constraints, and preferential cost functions to represent preferences. We show by examples that this allows the expression 
of very interesting preferences and constraints that, naturally, lead to quite diverse optimal plans.},

  abstract = {In my Ph.D. dissertation, I have studied problems arising in various aspects of preferences:
    preference modeling, preference learning, and preference reasoning, 
    when preferences concern outcomes ranging over combinatorial domains.
    Preferences is a major research component
    in artificial intelligence (AI) and decision theory, and is closely related to the 
    social choice theory considered by economists and political scientists. 
    In my dissertation, I have exploited emerging connections between 
    preferences in AI and social choice theory. 
    Most of my research is on qualitative preference representations that extend and combine
    existing formalisms such as conditional preference nets, 
    lexicographic preference trees, answer-set optimization programs,
    possibilistic logic, and conditional preference networks; on 
    learning problems that aim at discovering qualitative preference models and 
    predictive preference information from practical data; and on
    preference reasoning problems centered around qualitative preference optimization 
    and aggregation methods.
    Applications of my
    research include recommender systems, decision support tools, multi-agent systems,
    and Internet trading and marketing platforms.},
