  abstract = {Preference trees, or P-trees for short, offer an intuitive and
    often concise way of representing preferences over combinatorial domains.
    In this paper, we propose an alternative definition of p-trees, and formally
    define their compact representation that exploits occurrences of
    identical subtrees. We show that p-trees generalize lexicographic preference
    trees and are strictly more expressive. We relate p-trees to answer-set 
	optimization programs and possibilistic logic theories. Finally, we
    study reasoning with p-trees and establish computational complexity
    results for key reasoning tasks of comparing outcomes with respect to
    orders defined by p-trees, and of finding optimal outcomes.},

  abstract = {We introduce partial lexicographic preference trees (PLPtrees)
	as a formalism for compact representations of preferences
	over combinatorial domains. Our main results concern
	the problem of passive learning of PLP-trees. Specifically, for
	several classes of PLP-trees, we study how to learn (i) a PLPtree
	consistent with a dataset of examples, possibly subject to
	requirements on the size of the tree, and (ii) a PLP-tree correctly
	ordering as many of the examples as possible in case
	the dataset of examples is inconsistent. We establish complexity
	of these problems and, in all cases where the problem
	is in the class P, propose polynomial time algorithms.},

	are binary tuples. We assume that votes are specified as conditionally
	lexicographic preference trees, or LP trees for short. We study
	the aggregation of LP tree votes for several positional scoring rules. Our
	main goal is to demonstrate that answer-set programming tools can be
	effective in solving the winner and the evaluation problems for instances
	of practical sizes. To this end, we propose encodings of the two problems
	as answer-set programs, design methods to generate LP tree votes randomly
	to support experiments, and present experimental results obtained
	with ASP solvers clingo and clingcon.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new variant of hedonic coalition formation
	games in which agents have two levels of preference on their own coalitions:
	preference on the set of ``roles" that makes up the coalition, and
	preference on their own role within the coalition. We define several stability
	notions and optimization problems for this model. We prove the
	hardness of the decision problems related to our optimization criteria
	and show easiness of finding individually stable partitions. We introduce
	a heuristic optimizer for coalition formation in this setting. We evaluate
	results of the heuristic optimizer and the results of local search for
	individually stable partitions with respect to brute-force MaxSum and
	MaxMin solvers.},
