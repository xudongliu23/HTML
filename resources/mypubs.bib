  abstract = {Partial lexicographic preference trees, or PLP-trees, form an intuitive formalism for 
compact representation of qualitative preferences over combinatorial domains. We show that PLP-trees can be used
to accurately model preferences arising in practical situations, and that high-accuracy PLP-trees can
be effectively learned. We also propose and study learning methods for a variant of our model based
on the concept of a PLP-forest, a collection of PLP-trees, where the preference order specified by a
PLP-forest is obtained by aggregating the orders of its constituent PLP-trees. Our results demonstrate
the potential of both approaches, with learning PLP-forests showing particularly promising behavior.},

  abstract = {In my Ph.D. dissertation, I have studied problems arising in various aspects of preferences:
    preference modeling, preference learning, and preference reasoning, 
    when preferences concern outcomes ranging over combinatorial domains.
    Preferences is a major research component
    in artificial intelligence (AI) and decision theory, and is closely related to the 
    social choice theory considered by economists and political scientists. 
    In my dissertation, I have exploited emerging connections between 
    preferences in AI and social choice theory. 
    Most of my research is on qualitative preference representations that extend and combine
    existing formalisms such as conditional preference nets, 
    lexicographic preference trees, answer-set optimization programs,
    possibilistic logic, and conditional preference networks; on 
    learning problems that aim at discovering qualitative preference models and 
    predictive preference information from practical data; and on
    preference reasoning problems centered around qualitative preference optimization 
    and aggregation methods.
    Applications of my
    research include recommender systems, decision support tools, multi-agent systems,
    and Internet trading and marketing platforms.},

  abstract = {Preference trees, or P-trees for short, offer an intuitive and
    often concise way of representing preferences over combinatorial domains.
    In this paper, we propose an alternative definition of p-trees, and formally
    define their compact representation that exploits occurrences of
    identical subtrees. We show that p-trees generalize lexicographic preference
    trees and are strictly more expressive. We relate p-trees to answer-set 
	optimization programs and possibilistic logic theories. Finally, we
    study reasoning with p-trees and establish computational complexity
    results for key reasoning tasks of comparing outcomes with respect to
    orders defined by p-trees, and of finding optimal outcomes.},

	the problem of passive learning of PLP-trees. Specifically, for

	requirements on the size of the tree, and (ii) a PLP-tree correctly

	the dataset of examples is inconsistent. We establish complexity

	notions and optimization problems for this model. We prove the
	hardness of the decision problems related to our optimization criteria
