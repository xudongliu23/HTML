  abstract = {We study preference representation models based on partial lexicographic preference 
trees (PLP-trees). We propose to represent preference relations as forests of small 
PLP-trees (PLP-forests), and to use voting rules to aggregate orders represented by the individual 
trees into a single order to be taken as a model of the agent’s preference relation. 
We show that when learned from examples, PLP-forests have better accuracy than single PLP-trees. 
We also show that the choice of a voting rule does not have a major effect on the aggregated order, 
thus rendering the problem of selecting the “right” rule less critical. 
Next, for the proposed PLP-forest preference models, we develop methods to compute optimal 
and near-optimal outcomes, the tasks that appear difficult for some other common preference models. 
Lastly, we compare our models with those based on decision trees, which brings up questions for future research.},

PLP-forest is obtained by aggregating the orders of its constituent PLP-trees. Our results demonstrate
the potential of both approaches, with learning PLP-forests showing particularly promising behavior.},

  abstract = {In my Ph.D. dissertation, I have studied problems arising in various aspects of preferences:
    preference modeling, preference learning, and preference reasoning, 
    when preferences concern outcomes ranging over combinatorial domains.
    Preferences is a major research component
    in artificial intelligence (AI) and decision theory, and is closely related to the 
    social choice theory considered by economists and political scientists. 
    In my dissertation, I have exploited emerging connections between 
    preferences in AI and social choice theory. 
    Most of my research is on qualitative preference representations that extend and combine
    existing formalisms such as conditional preference nets, 
    lexicographic preference trees, answer-set optimization programs,
    possibilistic logic, and conditional preference networks; on 
    learning problems that aim at discovering qualitative preference models and 
    predictive preference information from practical data; and on
    preference reasoning problems centered around qualitative preference optimization 
    and aggregation methods.
    Applications of my
    research include recommender systems, decision support tools, multi-agent systems,
    and Internet trading and marketing platforms.},

    often concise way of representing preferences over combinatorial domains.
    In this paper, we propose an alternative definition of p-trees, and formally
    define their compact representation that exploits occurrences of
    identical subtrees. We show that p-trees generalize lexicographic preference
    trees and are strictly more expressive. We relate p-trees to answer-set 
	optimization programs and possibilistic logic theories. Finally, we
    study reasoning with p-trees and establish computational complexity
    results for key reasoning tasks of comparing outcomes with respect to
    orders defined by p-trees, and of finding optimal outcomes.},
